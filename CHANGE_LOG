Change Log for iScrobbler:

(Releases/comments tagged as RAB are by Rod Begbie)
(BDB is Brian Bergstrand)

v0.7.4 (BDB)
- New pref to disable version check. If enabled, iScrobbler will no longer open the Preferences window to notify you of a new version.
- Our scripts no longer use the Finder to gather system info. For those that use Finder alternatives, this means iScrobbler won't launch the Finder anymore.
- Internal changes to ready ourself for a 0.8.0 release.
- Fixed a bug that caused a song played two or more times sequentially to only be submitted once.

v0.7.3 (BDB)
- Added even more date verification for iPod songs to lessen the chance of server SPAM warnings.
- Implemented error detection in the iPod AppleScript.
- iScrobbler now has it's own private log file (~/Library/Logs/iScrobbler.log) so as not to pollute the Console. You can view this log by double clicking on it. It can get rather large, so every week or so you should choose "Clean Log" from the control menu.
- Removed mHash framework dependency. We now use the system provided functions (from libcrypto).
- Renamed "Sync iPod" to "Update iPod".
- Fixed a crash that occurred if we failed to verify the persistent cache file after it was written.
- Fixed several bugs in the iPod AppleScript date formatting, that caused iPod submissions to fail for non U.S. English users.
- Fixed a date storage bug that caused us to save a last played time that could be up to 30 seconds in the past, which in turn could cause us to submit a song already played in iTunes when an iPod was sync'd.
- Fixed another bug concerning the way we handle BADAUTH from the server on a submission. (Intro'd in 0.7.1).
- Fixed a bug that was causing the Preference window's "Last Song Submitted" field to show the previous submitted song, not the current one.
- Fixed some memory leaks (from 0.6.x).
- Fixed a bug in a support framework that would cause iPod sync to fail if the iPod name contained any non-ASCII characters.

v0.7.2 (BDB)
- Fixed a possible handshake bug that could cause handshaking to never complete when we recieved an unexpected server response.
- We now auto-resubmit when the server gives us a protocol error response (instead of doing it only for connection/HTTP errors).
- The minimum submit time (if we haven't reached half the track) is now four minutes.
- Fixed a bug concerning the way we handle BADAUTH from the server on a submission. (Intro'd in 0.7.1).

v0.7.1 (BDB)
- Added persistent cache (located at ~/Library/Application Support/net_sourceforge_iscrobbler_cache.plist).
- Songs less than 30 seconds are no longer submitted (as they are ignored by the server).
- If handshaking fails, the next attempt will be delayed by 1 minute. Each successive failure, will double the delay time up to a max of 2 hours. Auth failures are not limited.
- Handshaking is now done in the background, so there is no longer a possibility of iScrobbler hanging. We also attempt to detect and cancel possible "stuck" handshakes.
- If an error occurs during handshaking or song submission, a re-attempt will automatically be made after a certain delay instead of waiting for the next song to play.
- Code re-design to make Protocol v1.2 support easier to add.
- Added date verification to iPod sync to detect any bad play times in iTunes (and prevent spam warnings).
- Removed bug reporting, if you are having a problem, visit the forums, read the New and iTunes forums, and if you can't find a description of your problem, then (and only then) post a new entry to the iTunes forum (not the general forums!).
- De-metalized the prefs window.

v0.7.0 (BDB)
- Added support for iPod syncing.
Limitations:
 - If you start playing iTunes before syncing your iPod, then all songs on the iPod will be discarded.
 *Special note for users who have iPod Disk Mode enabled: Since iScrobbler delays syncing until the iPod is ejected, you must manually sync using the "Sync iPod" item in the control menu, or eject your iPod before you start playing music in iTunes. Either way, make sure to wait until iTunes says your iPod is "up to date".
 - Seeking a song on the iPod could trigger spam protection on the server.
- Fixed possible bug that would cause the Preferences window to fail to load.
- Fixed bug that reported "Last Submission Successful" in the details drawer even though the submission failed.

v0.6.4 (RAB):
- iScrobbler will no longer bitch that your username & password are wrong, just because the server says it once.  It'll try twice.  If the server *still* complains, *then* iScrobbler will pop-up the error message.
- Removed a bunch of extraneous logging statements.
- Encourage users to check the Audioscrobbler homepage before mailing bugs to the mailing list.

v0.6.3 (RAB):
- Fixed bug that caused crash on startup for some users (Mad props to Micah Gideon Modell for finding and fixing this)

v0.6.2 (RAB):
- Bug fixes to handle audioscrobbler.com being down (if you can imagine such a thing) more gracefully
- Fixed a bug that caused repeated submissions of same song after a FAILURE response
- Client can now correctly re-handshake with audioscrobbler.com if necessary

v0.6.1 (RAB):
- Update notifications correctly caught.
- Authentication errors cause the preferences window to appear and notify the user.
- Bug reports go to the SourceForge bugtracker/mailing list, rather than Sam.
- Actually does wait for 50% of song, as promised previously!

v0.6.0:
- RAB: Fixed for AudioScrobbler protocol v1.1
- RAB: Now submits Album Names to AudioScrobbler
- Rewrote submission logic. Now submissions wait until 50% of the song has completed, or two minutes has passed, whichever comes first.
- Queuing is now functional. If you are offline, or a connection cannot be established, a queue will be generated, to be submitted when the client can next open a connection with the server.
- A new client/server protocol is in place, with more advanced timing and communication between the server and the client, including 'defer' messages to instruct the client to wait a while in times of heavy server load, handshaking to exchange version data, and more.

v0.5.2:
- Cleaned up date format for improved server recognition. Solves problem where the "last ten" list wouldn't update properly on the website.
- Changed submission URL to match updated server settings

v0.5.1:

- Removed the Edit menu, as it isn't needed and was in a weird place. Copy/Paste didn't even work properly with it in, so we aren't losing anything. Use drag 'n' drop until copy/paste is fixed.
- Web Radio stream data does not get sent at all. This is until I figure out a better way to handle the applescript that gathers the data.
- Outgoing data has proper URL encoding. This should fix the problem with songs containing special characters (such as ampersands) not getting properly submitted.
- Ironically, the bug submission button was broken due to a silly interface mistake.
- Added a Bug Submit via Email button that uses your default email client, and automatically fills in some debugging data. This would be the preferred method of bug submission.
- Various server-side tweaks to improve error reporting and prevent double-escaping. This fixes the problem where a song with a title like "Whippin' Piccadilly" would be reported as "Whippin\' Piccadilly" when viewed on the website.

v0.5: Initial Release.
