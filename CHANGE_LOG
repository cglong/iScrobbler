KNOWN ISSUES:

- If you are burning a CD or editing a song's information or your computer is very busy, then iTunes may not be able to process Apple Events. Since iScrobbler communicates with iTunes via Apple Events, this can cause iScrobbler to miss songs that should be submitted.
- The Top Tracks Last Played date may not be in sync with the iTunes Last Played date as pause time is not considered. This is not a bug, just the way things work.
- There seems to be a conflict with Cocoa Gestures. If you have CG installed the iScrobbler menu items may be unusable.
- If you have submissions paused, then un-pause them and sync your iPod, all songs played in iTunes and on the iPod while paused will be submitted.

v2.0 (BDB)
b7:
- Find a Station accepts arbitrary user names to "find" a user and provides links to user playlists.
- Support for non-station Radio services (previews, full track plays, etc).

- Bug Fix: iTunes was being launched by iScrobbler when it wasn't really necessary.
b5:
- Radio songs are now submitted as required by the new Radio protocol (initial support in b4).
- Skip and Ban now affect locally played songs. The track will not be submitted, nor will it appear in the local charts. In addition, banned tracks are remembered and will not be submitted if played in the future.
- Removed ChatStatus plugin. It's obsoleted with the new Radio protocol implemented in b4.
b4:
- Radio works again after a fairly major rewrite because last.fm dropped support for the older Radio protocol.
- Bug Fix: Regression - iPod playlist menu in prefs did not contain any actual playlists.
- Bug Fix: Regression - searching for an artist or track would cause the search field to lose focus after typing a few characters.
b3:
- Dropped support for AS protocol 1.1, 1.2 will always be used.
- Local Chart dates are now shown from the date the database was created instead of a date in the past.
- New Profile report stat for Artists: Play Count per day/week
- If a new local charts database needs to be created, iScrobbler will first ask if you want to begin the import.

- Bug Fix: Better handling of Radio stream errors to keep iScrobbler's currently playing track in sync.
- Bug Fix: Regression - Tracks could spuriously be submitted multiple times when syncing an iPod because of an error in updating time of the last submission.
- Bug Fix: Regression - restored the ability to play songs during an iPod sync (broke in a4).

- Bug Fix: Possible (and likely) crash while generating a Profile report.
- Bug Fix: iTunes import would fail to import any songs for non-English users.
- Bug Fix: Regression - The Top Lists window was not remembering whether it was open or closed.

a6:
- Bug Fix: Crash when syncing an iPod.
- Bug Fix: The iTunes library import progress was not being displayed.
a5:
- Bug Fix: Crash on importing iTunes library.
- Bug Fix: The Tag window now opens with the text field having default focus.
a4:
- New local charts. They look the same, but there are now multiple separate charts maintained (including an Overall chart that starts with the import of your iTunes library).
-- Note: Because of the amount of data that can be generated and the computation required to maintain the chart data, iScrobbler can use quite a bit of memory (and briefly) quite a bit of CPU time.
- Multiple iPod play support (courtesy of a donation from einsteinbqat).
- New plugin to change the iChat status message to the currently playing Radio track. If you don't care for this, the plugin can be disabled from the Finder's 'Get Info' window.
- The Last.fm Artist and Track pages can be opened from the currently playing track menu.
- The last Radio station tuned can be accessed directly from the Radio menu.
- New Applescript command "show now playing" will display the Growl NP window.
- New Applescript commands "tag current track", "love current track", and "ban current track"
- The Growl 'Now Playing' note displays the currently tuned Radio station (if the radio is playing).
- If iScrobbler is quit and the Radio is playing, it will stop iTunes.
- Bug Fix: Possible crash when viewing the Artist Details drawer (intro'd in a2).
- Bug Fix: "Find Station" window always appears in front of other applications when it is opened.

- Bug Fix: The 'scrobble track plays' AppleScript command did not update the menu icon when changed.
- Bug Fix: After syncing an iPod, the queue would not submit until the next track play from iTunes.

a3:
- AppleScript support, including Radio control.
- Added option to tune an Artist's top fans radio instead of their similar artists radio.
- The Growl 'Now playing' notification can be displayed at any time by hovering the mouse over the menu.
- Elapsed and total track time are now included in the default track Growl display
- Album art for Radio tracks is displayed if possible.
- A revised album artwork cache now expires entries based on time and use and no longer has a fixed size. This should result in less memory use.
- iScrobbler will warn you (via Growl) if another Last.fm client application is running.
- Version checks are only attempted if the network monitor determines there's an active network connection.
- Bug fixes related to Radio track detection/display.
a2:
- Added Radio support for Friends, Neighbors, Tags, Global Tags, Groups and Artists stations.

- Added Connect item to the Radio submenu to start a connection when the Auto-Tune pref is not checked.
- Added "Now Playing" station to the Last.fm submenu.
- Added "My Playlist" station item to the Radio submenu.
- Played Radio tracks are recorded to the local profile.
- iScrobbler can handle external requests for lastfm:// URLs (for instance the "Play In Software" links on the last.fm website).

a1:
- Requires 10.4.9 or later
- Radio support! (Plays through iTunes.)

v1.5.2 (BDB)
- Bug Fix: Due to a change in Leopard, iScrobbler would fail to restore the persistent queue. In addition this same change could result in duplicate iPod submissions.
- Minor version check improvement.

v1.5.1 (BDB)
- New Local Profile Chart: Top Hours - play counts and time broken down by hour
- Growl iPod sync notification
- Growl play notifications will be coalesced if multiples are on screen
- Bug Fix: If submissions are paused while a song is playing, it won't be submitted.

v1.5 (BDB)
- iPod Shuffle support (courtesy of a donation from patsyfreer).
- You can now Love, Ban, Tag and Recommend the currently playing track and tracks in the Top Lists window (10.4+ only). To clear all tags associated with an item, set the mode to Overwrite and leave the tags empty.
- Songs can now be played in iTunes while a non-Shuffle iPod is syncing with iTunes. iTunes tracks will be queued locally until the sync is complete.
- The top three fans are now listed in the Artist Detail window.
- Removed "Your Fan Rating" from the Artist Details, and replaced it with a listing of the Artist tags (fully clickable).
- The Top Lists profile now includes the number of tracks played per day and the number of hours played per day (as tooltips).
- The Top Lists profile now includes the elapsed time since the last profile reset.
- Audioscrobbler Protocol 1.2 is now supported (and the default).
- Growl track notification layout change.
- A profile reset now requires confirmation.
- New icon courtesy of einsteinbqat.
- Removed outdated localizations.
- Bug Fix: Top Tracks search field was mis-behaving.
- Bug Fix: The auto version update check is now silent if there is no update.
- Bug Fix: It was possible for the submission countdown in the Stats window to get confused and display a completely invalid time.
- Bug Fix: The authentication warning dialog will now display when necessary.
- Bug Fix: Crash in version checker if an invalid XML file was downloaded.
- Bug Fix: Network down status is properly reflected in the note menu at launch.

v1.2.1 (BDB)
- Local Top Lists are now persistent. This is a rather rudimentary implementation in that all data is loaded in memory. So if you decide you want to keep a year's worth of data, be prepared for some large memory use and possible hangs while iScrobbler writes all of that data out every time a track is queued.
- Artist details are now displayed for the currently playing track (via the Statistics window).
- Reduced size of the queue file by about 2/3rds.
- If by the grace of Odin your MP3 files have an MBID ID3 tag, iScrobbler can now read it (thanks to David Nicolson).
- A 'Not all request variables are set' server error is now assumed to be a proxy truncation problem. When this error is detected iScrobbler will automatically reduce the size of its submissions in the belief that a smaller message size will make it through any misbehaving proxies fully intact.
- Version checking works again (no longer via last.fm).
- Fixed iPod submission failures due to change in iTunes 7.

v1.2 (BDB)
- New Artist details. When you select an artist/track in the Local Top Lists window, a drawer will open displaying a band image, fan data, and similar artists (all gathered from Audioscrobbler's web services). This feature is Tiger only.
- Redesigned Top Lists window to minimize vertical space use.
- Rudimentary support for MusicBrainz ID's. If the track comments contain an MBID, it will be submitted to the server. The format is: [MBID]<ID>[/MBID] where <ID> is replaced by the actual MBID. This is really just a stop gap measure to allow any songs that fail the Last.FM Artist/Track filters or songs less than 30 seconds.
- The time until track submission is displayed in the Stats window as part of the track info cycle.
- iScrobbler is a Universal app (for PPC and Intel).
- New Pause/Resume Submissions menu (by request). When paused, the note menu will change to a sharp. Plays from iTunes and iPod will both be ignored.
- The Artwork script has been optimized, there should be no more iTunes hangs even with the pref enabled.
- New application icon (provided by last.fm).
- For iPod submissions, the last submission date will now be used as the epoch if it's availble -- if not, then the last iTunes play time is used.
- Updated to Growl framework .7.4.
- iScrobbler will now install itself in the Login Items. If iScrobbler is later removed from Login Items it will not auto-install again.
- Fixed a possible "The variable trackPodcast is not defined." script error when playing some types of tracks.
- Workaround for a Tiger bug (fixed in 10.4.3) that causes iScrobbler not to recognize an active network connection on wake.

v1.1.2 (BDB)
- If a network connection is not available, the Note menu will change its color to orange.
- If a submission failure occurs, the menu color will stay red until the next submission attempt and a tooltip will be available with the error message.
- New pref "Enable Track Artwork". This is on by default -- if you experience problems with iTunes hanging, turn this off.
- German localization is now included thanks to Damrod.
- Updated Growl framework to .7.
- iPod tracks with a play date in the future (relative to the local system time) will now be discarded.
- Fixed: The note menu font no longer shrinks when changing colors.

v1.1.1 (BDB)
- IMPORTANT CHANGE: The log file is now automatically truncated during launch if it's larger than 2 MiB.
- The Note menu now changes colors to indicate submission activity -- black for no activity, green for in progress and red for failure.
- If your iPod contains an accessible volume icon, it will be displayed in the Stats window while a sync is in progress.
- Removed the "Clear Menu" and "Clean Log" menu items in a simplification effort.
- Fixed bug that caused the persistent cache to be lost w/o submission when upgrading from a pre-1.1 version.

v1.1 (BDB)
- OS X 10.3.9 + and iTunes 4.7.1 + are required.
- Added profile report generation (for local stats only) to the Top Lists.
- The stats window now displays the artwork for the currently playing song. Note: iTunes does not support artwork for Shared sources, so neither does iScrobbler.
- Enlarged stats window icon to 96x96 (for artwork).
- Added Growl support for track changes.
- iPod syncing is now supported for Manual mode (thanks to j-a-x).
- Double clicking on an item in the Top Lists tables will open the corresponding Artist/Track page on AS -- this works for most names, but some will fail.
- The total time played text in the stats window can now be copied.
- The network monitor should work better for some DSL users.
- iPod sync no longer uses date strings. This should make syncing much more robust.
- iPods that are mounted before starting iScrobbler will now be found.
- Fixed crasher when "Number of Recent Tracks" was set to "None" (thanks to squidinc).
- Fixed songs not being submitted when "Number of Recent Tracks" was set to "None". Of course the crash was hiding this problem.
- Fixed a bug where an artist/track could appear twice in the local Top Lists (because string compares were case-sensitive) -- the track was not submitted twice.
- Fixed problems with track names containing * and $ characters. Any character that iTunes supports, iScrobbler now supports.

v1.0.1 (BDB)
- The Top Artists list now includes the total time played for each artist.
- The Top Tracks list now contains the last played time for each track.
- Copy/Drag and Drop now work for the Top Lists tables. The data is formatted as TSV and can easily be pasted into a spreadsheet.
- The Tracks Submitted stat is now only updated after a submission attempt completes.
- Keychain error feedback.
- If a username has not been entered, the preferences window will automatically open during launch as it did in 0.7.x.
- Fixed bug that caused a song already in the submission queue and then played again to only be submitted once.
- Fixed bug that caused the Top Lists window to always open at startup.
- Fixed bug that caused the Statistics window to open at startup if it was opened and closed more than once during the previous session.
- Fixed bug that caused characters not available in the default text encoding to be munged (eth, w circumflex, etc).
- Workaround for iTunes cross-fading and/or network stream buffer issues that caused some songs to not be submitted.

v1.0.0 (BDB and ECS)
- This version (and all future versions) requires 10.3.0 or higher.
- Removed all third-party framework dependencies.
- The system proxy authentication settings are now supported.
- Redesigned preferences dialog.
- Redesigned error and update notification dialogs.
- Network status is now monitored, and we will only send when the network is available. Submissions will be queued until that time. 
- If iTunes 4.7 or greater is being used, we no longer have to constantly poll iTunes. Instead, iTunes will notify us when a new track is played. This reduces our lifetime CPU usage quite a bit.
- Tracks from iTunes Shared Music are now submitted by default.
- Redesigned and expanded client statistics -- including up-to-the-minute Top Artist and Track lists.
- Any suitable iTunes playlist can be used for iPod Submissions ("Recently Played" is no longer hard-coded).
- The client log level can now be set from the Preferences window. (Note: If you hover over each menu item long enough, a tool tip will appear explaining the meaning of each level.)
- The iTunes scripts no longer return file path info (it was never used in iScrobbler proper anyway).
- Human readable time zones are no longer included in the date strings we give to AppleScript. They are not necessary, and were just causing problems.
- More robust persitent cache and handling of bad track data.
- Connection timeout is now sixty seconds.
- Fixed a 24 byte memory leak that occured with every song played (from 0.6.x releases). According to Malloc Debug iScrobbler is now leak free!

v0.7.5 (BDB)
- Fixed a bug that caused us to URL encode HTTP post data twice. This bug has been around since the first iScrobbler release, but the old submission server had its own bug that canceled out our double encoding. However, the new Java submission server "fixed" this bug and so our double encoded strings started causing URL escape sequences to become part of the track data.

v0.7.4 (BDB)
- The Control window will now display the number of songs currently in the queue.
- New pref to disable version check. If enabled, iScrobbler will no longer open the Preferences window to notify you of a new version.
- Our scripts no longer use the Finder to gather system info. For those that use Finder alternatives, this means iScrobbler won't launch the Finder anymore.
- Internal changes to ready ourself for a 0.8.0 release.
- More robust server response parsing.
- If a song's Artist, or Title is missing the song will not be submitted (since it would be rejected by the server).
- Fixed a bug that caused a song played two or more times sequentially to only be submitted once.
- Fixed Cut/Copy/Paste not working (thanks to Wevah).

v0.7.3 (BDB)
- Added even more date verification for iPod songs to lessen the chance of server SPAM warnings.
- Implemented error detection in the iPod AppleScript.
- iScrobbler now has it's own private log file (~/Library/Logs/iScrobbler.log) so as not to pollute the Console. You can view this log by double clicking on it. It can get rather large, so every week or so you should choose "Clean Log" from the control menu.
- Removed mHash framework dependency. We now use the system provided functions (from libcrypto).
- Renamed "Sync iPod" to "Update iPod".
- Fixed a crash that occurred if we failed to verify the persistent cache file after it was written.
- Fixed several bugs in the iPod AppleScript date formatting, that caused iPod submissions to fail for non U.S. English users.
- Fixed a date storage bug that caused us to save a last played time that could be up to 30 seconds in the past, which in turn could cause us to submit a song already played in iTunes when an iPod was sync'd.
- Fixed another bug concerning the way we handle BADAUTH from the server on a submission. (Intro'd in 0.7.1).
- Fixed a bug that was causing the Preference window's "Last Song Submitted" field to show the previous submitted song, not the current one.
- Fixed some memory leaks (from 0.6.x).
- Fixed a bug in a support framework that would cause iPod sync to fail if the iPod name contained any non-ASCII characters.

v0.7.2 (BDB)
- Fixed a possible handshake bug that could cause handshaking to never complete when we recieved an unexpected server response.
- We now auto-resubmit when the server gives us a protocol error response (instead of doing it only for connection/HTTP errors).
- The minimum submit time (if we haven't reached half the track) is now four minutes.
- Fixed a bug concerning the way we handle BADAUTH from the server on a submission. (Intro'd in 0.7.1).

v0.7.1 (BDB)
- Added persistent cache (located at ~/Library/Application Support/net_sourceforge_iscrobbler_cache.plist).
- Songs less than 30 seconds are no longer submitted (as they are ignored by the server).
- If handshaking fails, the next attempt will be delayed by 1 minute. Each successive failure, will double the delay time up to a max of 2 hours. Auth failures are not limited.
- Handshaking is now done in the background, so there is no longer a possibility of iScrobbler hanging. We also attempt to detect and cancel possible "stuck" handshakes.
- If an error occurs during handshaking or song submission, a re-attempt will automatically be made after a certain delay instead of waiting for the next song to play.
- Code re-design to make Protocol v1.2 support easier to add.
- Added date verification to iPod sync to detect any bad play times in iTunes (and prevent spam warnings).
- Removed bug reporting, if you are having a problem, visit the forums, read the New and iTunes forums, and if you can't find a description of your problem, then (and only then) post a new entry to the iTunes forum (not the general forums!).
- De-metalized the prefs window.

v0.7.0 (BDB)
- Added support for iPod syncing.
Limitations:
 - If you start playing iTunes before syncing your iPod, then all songs on the iPod will be discarded.
 *Special note for users who have iPod Disk Mode enabled: Since iScrobbler delays syncing until the iPod is ejected, you must manually sync using the "Sync iPod" item in the control menu, or eject your iPod before you start playing music in iTunes. Either way, make sure to wait until iTunes says your iPod is "up to date".
 - Seeking a song on the iPod could trigger spam protection on the server.
- Fixed possible bug that would cause the Preferences window to fail to load.
- Fixed bug that reported "Last Submission Successful" in the details drawer even though the submission failed.

v0.6.4 (RAB):
- iScrobbler will no longer bitch that your username & password are wrong, just because the server says it once.  It'll try twice.  If the server *still* complains, *then* iScrobbler will pop-up the error message.
- Removed a bunch of extraneous logging statements.
- Encourage users to check the Audioscrobbler homepage before mailing bugs to the mailing list.

v0.6.3 (RAB):
- Fixed bug that caused crash on startup for some users (Mad props to Micah Gideon Modell for finding and fixing this)

v0.6.2 (RAB):
- Bug fixes to handle audioscrobbler.com being down (if you can imagine such a thing) more gracefully
- Fixed a bug that caused repeated submissions of same song after a FAILURE response
- Client can now correctly re-handshake with audioscrobbler.com if necessary

v0.6.1 (RAB):
- Update notifications correctly caught.
- Authentication errors cause the preferences window to appear and notify the user.
- Bug reports go to the SourceForge bugtracker/mailing list, rather than Sam.
- Actually does wait for 50% of song, as promised previously!

v0.6.0:
- RAB: Fixed for AudioScrobbler protocol v1.1
- RAB: Now submits Album Names to AudioScrobbler
- Rewrote submission logic. Now submissions wait until 50% of the song has completed, or two minutes has passed, whichever comes first.
- Queuing is now functional. If you are offline, or a connection cannot be established, a queue will be generated, to be submitted when the client can next open a connection with the server.
- A new client/server protocol is in place, with more advanced timing and communication between the server and the client, including 'defer' messages to instruct the client to wait a while in times of heavy server load, handshaking to exchange version data, and more.

v0.5.2:
- Cleaned up date format for improved server recognition. Solves problem where the "last ten" list wouldn't update properly on the website.
- Changed submission URL to match updated server settings

v0.5.1:

- Removed the Edit menu, as it isn't needed and was in a weird place. Copy/Paste didn't even work properly with it in, so we aren't losing anything. Use drag 'n' drop until copy/paste is fixed.
- Web Radio stream data does not get sent at all. This is until I figure out a better way to handle the applescript that gathers the data.
- Outgoing data has proper URL encoding. This should fix the problem with songs containing special characters (such as ampersands) not getting properly submitted.
- Ironically, the bug submission button was broken due to a silly interface mistake.
- Added a Bug Submit via Email button that uses your default email client, and automatically fills in some debugging data. This would be the preferred method of bug submission.
- Various server-side tweaks to improve error reporting and prevent double-escaping. This fixes the problem where a song with a title like "Whippin' Piccadilly" would be reported as "Whippin\' Piccadilly" when viewed on the website.

v0.5: Initial Release.
