Change Log for iScrobbler:

v0.6.1:
- Update notifications correctly caught.
- Authentication errors cause the preferences window to appear and notify the user.
- Bug reports go to the SourceForge bugtracker/mailing list, rather than Sam.
- Actually does wait for 50% of song, as promised previously!

v0.6.0:
- RAB: Fixed for AudioScrobbler protocol v1.1
- RAB: Now submits Album Names to AudioScrobbler
- Rewrote submission logic. Now submissions wait until 50% of the song has completed, or two minutes has passed, whichever comes first.
- Queuing is now functional. If you are offline, or a connection cannot be established, a queue will be generated, to be submitted when the client can next open a connection with the server.
- A new client/server protocol is in place, with more advanced timing and communication between the server and the client, including 'defer' messages to instruct the client to wait a while in times of heavy server load, handshaking to exchange version data, and more.

v0.5.2:
- Cleaned up date format for improved server recognition. Solves problem where the "last ten" list wouldn't update properly on the website.
- Changed submission URL to match updated server settings

v0.5.1:

- Removed the Edit menu, as it isn't needed and was in a weird place. Copy/Paste didn't even work properly with it in, so we aren't losing anything. Use drag 'n' drop until copy/paste is fixed.
- Web Radio stream data does not get sent at all. This is until I figure out a better way to handle the applescript that gathers the data.
- Outgoing data has proper URL encoding. This should fix the problem with songs containing special characters (such as ampersands) not getting properly submitted.
- Ironically, the bug submission button was broken due to a silly interface mistake.
- Added a Bug Submit via Email button that uses your default email client, and automatically fills in some debugging data. This would be the preferred method of bug submission.
- Various server-side tweaks to improve error reporting and prevent double-escaping. This fixes the problem where a song with a title like "Whippin' Piccadilly" would be reported as "Whippin\' Piccadilly" when viewed on the website.

v0.5: Initial Release.
